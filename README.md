# UJINGA

Ujinga - means STUPIDITY in swahili. This is a Web UI Framework (like React or Angular), made just for fun. And I consider it stupidity. Why swahili? I don't know, it just caught my eye on google translate.

DISCLAIMER: Unlike the regular event-state structure of UI frameworks, Ujinga follows the traditional MVC pattern, where controller contains all the decisions, model conducts all the DB operations, and view renders the interface. 

A little modification might be added later, if necessary. That is, traditional model will be used to keep data structure, and a repository will be used for conducting DB communication.
